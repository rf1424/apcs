 HW 82: Roll Your Own Iterator
 2022-03-25
 Spent: 0.5 hrs


DISCO
 - It's cool how implementing Iterable functionality allows us to a foreach loop
 - Private class usage is pretty cool! I wonder how many private classes you can have in one file.

QCC
 - How come using a foreach loop on a linkedlist doesn't let you see the last element of the list?
 - Trying to use .iterator() outside of the LList class doesn't seem to be possible. Why is that?
