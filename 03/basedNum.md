Binary and Decimal Representations: 
The base of a number system is determined by how many different digits are being used in each place value. 
For instance, base 2 representation uses two digits 0 and 1. Base 10 representation uses ten digits 0-9. 



Definition of Binary: 
Binary is a counting system consisting of only two numbers 1 and 0. Each digit is either 1 or 0, always in one of two states. 
Transitors are the building blocks of computers; they operate with two switches, which can be expressed using base 2. 


Decimal to Binary: 
0. Take a base 10 number x. If x is even, write x:0. If x is odd, write x:1. The left number(0 or 1) is the first remainder. 
1. Divide x by 2. Write down the quotient and the remainder in this form below.
   quotient:remainder
2. Take the quotient and divide it by 2 again. Write down the new quotient and the remainder in the same "quotient:remainder" form. 
3. Continue step 1 until the quotient becomes 1. 
4. Take and align the remainders from left to right, starting with the first remainder. 

Example: 345
345:1 
172:0
86:0
43:1
21:1
10:0
