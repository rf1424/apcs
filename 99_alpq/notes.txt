HW99 -- Some Are More Equal Than Others, Codified
2022-05-16
time spent: 0.7 hrs

DISCO:
- You can consider priority at either dequeue or enqueue, but if enqueue is O(1),
  then peekMin and removeMin are both O(n).
- An array for each element can store priority with value.

QCC:
- Should the queue store ints, or be generically typed?
