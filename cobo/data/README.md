Q/As

Activity 1.
  1.  We use Google classroom, GitHub, the Stuy APCS page, and
      YouTube.
  2.  GitHub privacy policies say that they collect registration
      info (username, password, etc.), payment information, and
      profile information (avatar/bio).
  3.  Delimited means separated. Each entry of a data set can be
      separated and extracted from a list.
  4.  The name of the column (data type may or may not be specified)
      can suggest what type of data will be stored in that column (ex.
      name will be a string).
  5.  Pokemon and Music
  6.  Who is the most popular pokemon character? (its n)
      What was the most popular rock band in the 90s?
  7.  Reddit pollsw
  8.  MANY REDDIT POLLS. One advantage of having more data is that the larger data is
      less swung by outliers.
  9.  With services like Spotify, the songs that some individuals listen
      to can help the site recognize what artists/genres are similar and
      base recommendations to others on that info. So, having more users
      and data can lead to better predictions and suggestions. Not sure
      of benefits outside of the service.
  10. I'm not sure how information is processed but I believe Spotify
      creates networks of users that are similar and artists that are
      frequently listened to together, which help to decide recommendations.
  11. In the case of Spotify, yes, but most other forms (like targeted
      ads) are definitely an invasion of privacy.

Activity 2.
  1.  Call it a "cereal".
  2.  N/A
  3.  public class Cereal
  4.  15, one for each property of a cereal listed in the table.
  5.  Name (String), Type (char), Calories, Protein, Fat, Sodium (all ints),
      Fiber, Carbohydrates, Sugar (all doubles), Potassium, Vitamins, Shelf
      (all ints), Weight, Cups, Rating (all doubles).
  8.  How does the amount of protein in Whey compare to that of Corn Pops?
  9.  Which cereal is ranked the highest? (there are no comparison methods).
  10. Add a method that will compare each variable for two instances of Cereal.

  Activity 3.
  1.  The temperature at Atlanta, Hartsfield - Jackson Atlanta International
      Airport, GA is 65.0F.
  2.  Code: KALB
      Display: The temperature at Albany International Airport, NY is 57.0F.
  4.  47
  5.  You can filter stations by longitude.
  6.  NSTU: Pago Pago, AS, Samoa.
  7.  We can filter based on longitude. We could answer if longitude is
      related to temperature.
  8.  It would basically be the same as with latitude.
