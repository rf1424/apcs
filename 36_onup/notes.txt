Kind of errors
1. Compile-time errors: something wrong with syntax
2. Run-time errors: something wrong while running the program
3. Logic errors: program does the wrong thing


1. Compile-time errors
- debugging by bijection (halve the code and test)
- error messages inform that something is wrong,
  but their solutions are not always reliable

2. Run-time errors
- "program is hanging"
- add print statements to find the error
    -Ex: "System.out.println("enter method x")

3. Logic errors
- have a mental model/flow chart of your code
- floating-point numbers are only approximate
    -Use (Math.abs(d - 1.23) < .000001) for approximation

Additional tips
- step away from computer and think
- summon duckie, then another person
