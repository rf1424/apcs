DISCO
  04/12
  - According to the Oracle, the toString() method is inherited from java.util.AbstractCollection
  - Mr. K's students' drivers are really useful for making sure our implementation is correct!

  - Thank god for the fact LinkedLists implements all of Deques methods
  - ArrayDeques are a thing, but we've decided not to touch them

QCC
  04/12
  - Given how LinkedList implements all of Deque's methods, were we supposed to implement all of Deque's methods?
  - Are we supposed to use LinkedList's methods to trivialize the implementation of deque?
  - How bad is writing a Deque implementation using an ArrayList?
  04/13
  - How large should our MRKPirateBae tester be?
  - Much like yesterday, were we supposed to implement all of the official Deque's methods?
  - Who is QQKachoo??
