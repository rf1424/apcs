DISCO
  - According to the Oracle, the toString() method is inherited from java.util.AbstractCollection
  - Mr. K's students' drivers are really useful for making sure our implementation is correct!

QCC
  - Given how LinkedList implements all of Deque's methods, were we supposed to implement all of Deque's methods?
  - Are we supposed to use LinkedList's methods to trivialize the implementation of deque?
  - How bad is writing a Deque implementation using an ArrayList?
