HW60 -- A Termite is-a Turtle, a Thinker is-a Turtle
Time: 0.5 hrs


DISCO
- Each turtle follows the same set of instructions. â†“
- I am guessing that there are some recursive steps involved in the process. 
- It's similar to the termites simulation:
  - termites start by creating smaller piles and combine these piles into a larger one
  - we make smaller sorted lists and combine them gradually with each pass back 


QCC
- Why couldn't you look at your deck of cards in class? How do you merge decks without looking? 
- How efficient is this algorithm? 


THINKER FIRMWARE (Instructions each turtle follows)
- When you recieve a deck, check if there is only one card. 
   - If there is only one card, hand the card back to the giver. 
   - Else, split the deck in half and give them each to two new turtles.  
- When you recieve two decks, perform the merging algorithm for sorted lists. 
  Once you are done, hand the merged deck to your original/first giver.
