DISCO:
- We should only add new terms as leaves because we can't guarantee that
  everything to the left/right is less/greater otherwise.
- Getting the pre, in, and post order traversals is a very simple recursive call.

QCC:
- The tree changes depending on the order in which you add elements, so how many
  distinct binary search trees are there for a given dataset?

Q/As:
With L = level, d = depth, h = height ...
1. A perfect binary tree has 2^L-1 / 2^(d+1)-1 / 2^(h+1)-1 nodes.
2. At each level (n), a perfect binary tree has 2^(n-1) nodes.
3. Height of a complete binary tree with n nodes is ceil(log_2(n+1)) - 1.
